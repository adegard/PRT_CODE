# PRT_CODE
If you like to save your code in ".txt" document on your computer and read it in Notepad++  I done a custom language definition to retrieve the same "color" as prorealtime platform and crate your code "offline". (some example ofrendering in attachement)

1. Download PRT.xml  (Right-click and choosing save as target...)
2. Save it to the right location C:\Program Files\Notepad++\PRT.xml (on 32-Bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\PRT.xml)
3. Start Notepad++ and click on Menu Language -> Define your language
4. Import your userDefineLang
5. Restart Notepad++

There is still some missing functions. If someone improve it, I will update further versions on github ;-)
